"Inter-service communication in Microservice Architectures with Redis Streams","Redis Streams, the popular append-only data structure available in Redis together with other popular data structures, serve many use cases. In this post, I will focus on setting up a simple inter-service communication mechanism. I will take as an example a knowledge base application (keybase) that I developed and is available for free (MIT license). Keybase is a simple Flask document-serving server backed by Redis Stack. You can learn more in this blog post. Clone the repository and test it locally on your computer. The knowledge base implements document recommendations based on Vector Similarity Search (VSS), which offers real-time semantic searches. If you want to learn more about VSS, I have introduced it in two former posts: Face Recognition with RediSearch and Vector Similarity and Recommended Documents with RediSearch using Python and Lua scripting. VSS is based on the generation, storage, and indexing of vector embeddings. This means that every time a user creates a new document, a vector must be generated using one of the popular machine learning models (such as the Sentence Transformers library). Embeddings must also be regenerated whenever a document is updated with new content, so the embedding will represent the updated content. Once the vector has been generated, it can be stored in the database. Only at this point, Redis will proceed to update the index."
"Import the World Database into Redis","I often need some dummy data for my tests and, as used as I am to import the SQL dump of the into MySQL, I wanted to make consistent tests and examples against the same simple dataset. So I converted the three tables of this dataset into Redis commands, so you can import the data should you need it. The entities storing the data are Hashes. As reported in the source database, the world database is Copyright Statistics Finland."
"Principles of Storytelling","When there is a good story behind a product, content, a presentation… anything looks better, appealing, and familiar to the target audience. I work as a Technical Enablement Architect, in charge of producing technical educational content and delivering onboarding sessions, among other things, and that is one of the reasons I feel this challenge is particularly urgent (and Plato came to the same conclusion a long, long time ago). Engaging an audience is challenging: owning and respecting other people’s time should always be the highest priority for those who are producing and delivering content. In the end, we all want to live great experiences, and if the audience will have a good time, it is likely that we have created value. When you need to research content for your presentation, tutorial, article, or anything that you’d like to turn into a resource to transmit information and, eventually, educate people, you can start browsing the Internet for sure, dump your notes into a text file, reorganize them with your personal touch and connect the dots. That usually works. Having an SME (Subject Matter Expert) at hand is even better. Experts will help filter the right content with their experience and authority while reassuring that the material is suitable and well-scoped. Therefore it is possible to summarize as follows. Ask. By recurring to an expert on that matter. Research. The Internet, libraries, documents, knowledge bases, etc. MBWA (Manage By Walking Around). Get up and move around: go to the desks of your colleagues if you are in the office, drink coffee and conversate during lunch breaks. You’ll see how informal learning is effective, and even more honest when it happens in an unpredictable way."
"Recommended Documents with RediSearch using Python and Lua scripting","The idea behind recommendations using Vector Similarity Search (VSS) is to transform a text into its corresponding vector embedding and use it to find similar vectors, which are associated and represent other documents. Without further ado, let’s describe the example you can find in the corresponding repository. I will show how to implement a system to recommend articles that are similar to one provided article, and for this purpose, I have collected 9 articles subdivided into 3 categories: sport, news, and culture. These articles are written into a file in JSON format, one article per line. In this example, I leverage RediSearch VSS capabilities to implement recommendations for textual content. The example is provided in Python language, and takes advantage of Redis Lua scripting to fetch the vector embedding and perform the search on the fly against all the articles in the keyspace (oh, the good old join!).

"Face Recognition with RediSearch and Vector Similarity","Using this feature, it is possible to index heterogeneous sources of data once converted in their corresponding vector embedding, and then use such index to perform similarity search. Refer to the RediSearch description and detailed documentation of vector similarity. In this post, I will extend the examples that I have written some time ago when I classified vector embeddings using either an iterative approach (minimum distance between vectors) and using Hierarchical Navigable Small World similarity search (HNSW) for the classification, made available by hnswlib Python library. For this post, I have used Redis to classify faces in a face recognition system, taking advantage of RediSearch Vector Similarity new feature. I am using the redis-py new extension for Vector Similarity. Find the documentation here: vector similarity with redis-py. RediSearch implementation of the nearest neighbor search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (HNSW) works smoothly and behaves as expected, with an expected recognition rate of 97% on the ORL face database, if benchmarked against other similar libraries (e.g. hnswlib Python library). With the additional speed of Redis and the scalability of Redis Enterprise and Redis Cloud, I foresee a lot of fun turning the most different and creative ideas into reality. Remember, you can use RediSearch with Vector Similarity using Redis OSS, Redis Enterprise, and the managed Redis Cloud."
"Introduction to Face Recognition using Python","A few years ago (just a few, in 2003) I discussed the thesis for my degree in Electronic Engineering: “Classification of Log-Gabor Features for Biometric Face Recognition“. It was a really engaging project and I achieved good results in terms of recognition rate using a wavelet transform and a neural network classificator. Afterward, I dropped the topic and did not develop it further. Maybe I will post some results someday. Back to these times, a few days ago I decided to spend some spare time testing feature extraction and classification in Python and created this repository with a couple of tests. Here are some assumptions. I am using the “The ORL Database of Faces” to train and test a system for feature extraction and classification. The ORL database is among the simplest face databases, made up of pictures of 40 individuals, 10 pictures each, for a total of 400 pictures, 92×112 black and white bitmaps. The faces are already aligned, normalized, and ready to pass through a feature extraction algorithm. I am using 5 images to train the system and the remaining 5 images for testing through the classification algorithm. So, in total, there are 200 training faces for 40 individuals and 200 testing faces."
"From SQL to Redis Searches: an introduction","In my previous post I shared a few methods to export a table from MySQL (or any other relational database) and import the rows into Redis Server in the form of Redis Hashes, which is a convenient Redis data structure for this purpose. Now the next step is understanding how to operate with this Redis data type to perform the most common searches. So let’s see a few examples of common SQL queries and how to achieve the same results in Redis. In the following examples I will use the world database to perform the example and whose table city was imported in the previous post into Redis. Redis Server offers plenty of capabilities to manage indexes manually (or even inverted indexes for full text searches). In this post I have gone through basic examples, but the options to retrieve data using the core data types are unlimited. If you want to take advantage of advanced features for searches, you can use RediSearch with Redis OSS, Redis Enterprise and Redis Enterprise Cloud, taking searches to a new level. In these examples I have used redis-cli, check client libraries such as redis-py to test the features of RediSearch using Python. Finally, RediSearch is not just about range or prefix searches, or aggregation queries. There are multiple types of searches, such as phonetic matching, autocompletion suggestions, geo searches or the spellchecker to help design great applications. I will cover them in a future post."
"Migrate a MySQL Table to Redis","In this post I will list a few options to migrate a table from MySQL to Redis logically. I will run examples using the classical world database. The world database can be downloaded here, so if you would like to try the examples, just import it in your MySQL instance. There are several ways to go ahead and import a table into Redis, let’s go through some of them. In the following examples I will choose a Hash data type, the most similar thing to a traditional table row in Redis."
"Connect to Redis with Python","Python clients you can use to connect to a Redis Server are listed in the documentation. I personally use redis-py, but Redis the company has just released Redis OM for Python, so I think it is worth to have a look. I will share here basic instructions to connect to a Redis Server and test a couple of commands. Python clients you can use to connect to a Redis Server are listed in the documentation. I personally use redis-py, but Redis the company has just released Redis OM for Python, so I think it is worth to have a look. I will share here basic instructions to connect to a Redis Server and test a couple of commands. Using redis-py or any other similar connector, you will have access to well known data structures and the usual commands. But for advanced users, Redis OM for Python is the deus ex machina which boosts expressiveness of the code, and therefore unleash the whole potential of data modelling using Redis. Presented in December 2021, Redis OM is a brand new library that enables developers to use object mapping, data validation, indexes, nested data structures using JSON and the ability to interact with all these features in a compact way, from the same library and, above all, without compromising on the performance you are used to."
"Understand, Setup and Test a Redis Cluster in less than 10 minutes","You already know how to setup a Redis Server in a few seconds following my advices in this post, now it’s time to think big and learn how to scale a Redis Server. Let’s start with a quote from the documentation. ""Redis is, mostly, a single-threaded server from the POV of commands execution (actually modern versions of Redis use threads for different things). It is not designed to benefit from multiple CPU cores. People are supposed to launch several Redis instances to scale out on several cores if needed"". So in a Redis Server, all the data is stored in the memory space of the process itself and managed by a single core. To take advantage of multiple cores (in the same machine or other machines), the dataset must be divided in multiple pieces, where every piece is managed by the processing capacity of a core. And this is possible with Redis Cluster."
"Setup Redis in (Much) Less Than 60 seconds!","I have been away for some time from this blog, but that was for a reason, I got a new job at Redis (and I can’t hide I am truly enthusiastic about my new position as Technical Enablement Architect!), and taking some time to onboard and extend my knowledge of the awesome Redis server, the popular in-memory key-value storage. So my future posts will likely be about Redis and the infinite chances to “getting things done” using this very nice solution. Maybe you know Redis as an efficient caching layer, but once you get to know it a bit more, you realize that Redis has all the qualities to be your only primary database (and especially once you discover Redis Enterprise features for a highly scalable and configurable solution). You can create a free Redis Cloud account here. Maybe it won’t be a matter of seconds, but I promise it will be just a few minutes! You can get a 30MB database and a public endpoint to authenticate right away from your laptop. No VPN, no certificates setup, can’t be easier. And it’s free, forever!"
"Things I learnt to improve communication at work","What happens when communication between people is not that efficient and clear in the business world? I am sure you know pretty well the following picture. Misunderstandings happen all the time when the actors in discussions, conversations or negotiations have an idea in mind which is tough to convey. Or when one is not really listening to the other and just have his own idea in mind. Sadly, misunderstandings happen. Quite often. And this problem is time and money consuming. But above all, relationships get severely affected when expectation is betrayed, somehow, by too many assumptions. What I learnt is that in order to make ideas caught by a partner and across the different communication channels, simple rules need to be followed. Let’s go through some ideas."
"Differences between Copyright, Copyleft and Creative Commons","Motivated by the suspension of famous Spanish writer Javier Marias’ blog because of license infringement, I searched the web and found the following comparison of licenses to stay on the safe side when reusing, mentioning or modifying content found on the web. The infringement was reported by Michael Magras: part of a post from his blog was copied in Marias’ blog without acknowledging the authorship. This resulted in a claim to WordPress blogging platform and consequent suspension of the blog. All the three licenses have something in common: they all deal with author’s rights. They just differs in the way they protect them. Copyright is the most popular license, and unfortunately it’s the most used one. It allows full rights to the owner of the work (that may not be the very author), and he’s the only one that may decide what to do with it, whether to charge for it or not, besides having to request permission for usage. Distribution is only restricted to the owner of the creation, that means the license only allows possession but not distribution. This is usually applied to books, music, movies and software, as an example. Copyleft and Creative Commons license are pretty the same, this is because copyleft is the mother license for Creative Commons. This is quite the opposite of Copyright. Works are not restricted by any constraint: they can be modified, shared with other users and content can be copied. Modification of original work may even be commercial.

"Your first meditation in three steps: Anapanasati yoga","There’s a lot of buzz around meditation, and for those who are not into that, it sounds a bit like a mysterious way to achieve who knows what. Enlightenment, peace of senses, eternal pleasure or visits to other dimensions? This is not exactly like that, but benefits that people receive by practicing meditation are tangible and immediate. Mind relaxation, better concentration and improved consciousness of oneself. The good thing is that everybody can meditate and no special preparation is needed nor a special place or time of the day. The purpose of this technique, known as Anapanasati yoga, is to enhance consciousness of yourself. Your thoughts wander throughout all the day randomly, you can’t do much to control them. Your thoughts will drift, and so they’ll do during this simple breath observation technique. But don’t worry, this is a challenge that’s part of the exercise. Just make sure you realize you jumped to other thoughts, to your family, your duties and obligations. Don’t feel guilty for that, but once you notice you have abandoned the practice, go back to it, go back to breath observation. Don’t expect things will happen. Keep expectation low. Just consider the way you feel once the session is over. Once you are used to this practice, don’t wait for the perfect moment for it. Every moment of the day and in any place it’s perfect. In the bus, while waiting the subway… these are perfect places for Anapanasati yoga. You don’t even need to keep you eyes opened. You can even observe your breath while walking in the street, this method won’t take consciousness away from what’s happening around you. And why not, try that for some minutes in front of your computer at work. Nobody will notice that!"
"Free Open Source Software in your company","The vast majority of companies in software industry struggle to cut costs down while trying to keep quality of software high, but this is not easy to accomplish. Software development is radically different from any other industry you may want to consider for a comparison; in order to be a successful firm neither large investments nor brute force are strategic assets. The new wave of millionaire start-up businesses prove that besides a brilliant idea, user experience, great design and definitely competitive time to market are critical. Consider the main resource of any business: employees, as an example. Increasing number of employees does not ensure goals are achieved either faster or even with better quality (back to the start-up mention, Instagram started with less than ten employees). Nevertheless, hiring top class experts in this business may be the added value: experience and talent are essential when building intellectual value. Cutting costs down and taking advantage of expertise, that’s what triggered the adoption of Free Open Source Software (FOSS) in this industry. Professionalism and passion of huge number of communities of developers are among the main reasons for company to rely on FOSS. Not just because by adopting software components ready to use accelerates production and delivery, but also because quality uses to be assured by an army of skilled volunteers. On the other side, bringing FOSS into development processes must be done with care. Free software doesn’t mean free of control. FOSS is always released with a license, and it’s responsibility of the adopter to comply with constraints of that license."
"The creative process","Companies spend a lot of money in finding the best creative people, strategists, advertisers and brilliant —and expensive— talents. Besides, you can find hundreds of resources dealing with the challenge of thinking different, self-improvement trainings, coaching sessions, brainstorming exercises, breaking ways of working… Actually some tutorials may be really inspiring, and the more material you collect, the more aware you are about the behaviors to maintain and to avoid in order to enhance your inspiration. But never forget, that a relaxed attitude often helps to have the possibility to produce wonderful combinations and the craziest ideas. This is the reason why people have great ideas in the bathroom. So take your time and experiment, mix experiences from different environment and increase your background, even randomly. You can never tell where that astonishing discovery may hide. Live."
"iPad update and family quarrel","My mother sustains that my father —he’s 73 years old and owner of his first Internet connected device ever since August: the new iPad— only wanted to “have that red spot disappear” (the notification of firmware update). She also added that she’s upset because in the last four months he’s been stuck to his iPad the whole day, and that he gets angry at the tablet because he wants to learn more and more but he still commits errors. My father replies this is not true and that he uses the iPad just from time to time along the day to discover what sickness is associated to his symptoms. My mother sustains he’s lying, and that he’s getting day by day more nervous and that at his age he shouldn’t spend his whole time in front of a screen."
"Extraordinariness is not ordinary","Who has ever been acknowledged for doing something the extraordinary way —a great speech, a performance or a job— surely remembers that occasion with delight. Every once in a while, he enjoys the memory of that sublime moment and possibly wonder what was so determining to have himself covered with glory. And maybe one might wish to find out the recipe to repeat those brilliant actions to ensure success over and over again. What is extraordinariness like. It is what goes beyond, the result that nobody ever imagined might be possible. It is not a matter of exceeding expectation. It means astonishing people thanks to the impact of the unexpected and the anxiety of perfection; it is scaring, provocative, surprising and uncomfortable. It makes you jump off the chair. It is freedom from the chains of common sense, it is the conclusion nobody was waiting for. And maybe when nobody was even expecting a conclusion to come. Free initiave out of schemas is extraordinariness. In a world that promotes team work, collaborative environments, factotum employees and supportive behaviours, the outcome of the artist is extraordinariness, it is the production of the creative mind doing it all the indipendent way, out there alone."
"How to close your speech with impact","Whenever you speak in public, never forget to start with a great introduction to capture your audience from the very beginning. But also, never forget to close your speech in an unforgettable manner. Your conclusions must awake people inner feelings, you must inspire them and provide them with a practical way to introduce your lesson into their own life. If you don’t transmit values and touch people’s heart, your preparation and work would seem boring and useless to them. Your conclusion must also deliver the sense that your speech is over, not just by saying “Thanks so much for your attention”."
"The real innovation funnel in companies","If you think that innovating in your company is a hard stuff, welcome! We are a bunch of people convinced that you have to pass through difficult, or better, impossible challenges to see an idea reach the production stage and possibly provide benefits. I heard that one idea out of a hundred good ones reach maturity stage and turns into reality, somehow. According to my experience, this is true. But it does not represent a problem, really. Start brainstorming as soon as possible, you’ll need plenty of smart ideas. The winning idea is like the Highlander, there can be only one."
